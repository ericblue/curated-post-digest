Around 40k lines added and 38k removed. Every single line was generated by Claude Code running on Opus 4.5.\n\nWhat stands out is not just the volume, but the way it was used. Claude ran **continuously** for minutes, hours and **sometimes days** using stop hooks, handling long-running tasks instead of short prompt-response loops.\n\nHis **usage stats** show ~325 million tokens across 1.6k sessions, with a longest single session of nearly 2 days. According to him, **code** is no longer the bottleneck. Execution and direction are.\n\nThis feels less like a demo and more like an early look at how agentic coding workflows actually behave in **real production** environments.\n\n**Source: Boris Cherny**\n\n🔗: https://x.com/i/status/2004887829252317325",

      "selftext": "I have a theory about why Claude (specifically Opus 4.5) feels so different from other models. (ironically, I discovered it through Google Antigravity, tried gemini 3 pro, didn't fall in love, but then tested Opus and something clicked)\n\nIt's just so coherent. Professional. I almost want to say adult and sane. Grounded.\n\n**ChatGPT** feels like a jolly hipster who will smile and confidently tell you complete bullshit while looking you straight in the eyes. It's like the core model is a chaotic people-pleaser, and they've glued 30 layers of system prompts on top to make it behave. It works, mostly, but you can sense it's unstable, like it could go off the rails at any moment.\n\n**Gemini** is better, but it hallucinates and can get stuck in its own thought loops. It'll make the same error over and over, convinced that the next tiny change will fix it, but it can't step outside itself to see the bigger picture. If that makes sense.\n\n**Then I tried Claude.** Specifically Opus 4.5 And I was blown away by how coherent, well-structured, and analytical it is. So refreshing. And then I started wondering: *how?* And more importantly, *why?* What makes Claude different?\n\n  \nSo here's my Theory...\n\nAnthropic built Claude with ethics as a core goal. Don't deceive. Don't lie. Don't harm.\n\nBut here's the thing, what if training a model to be ethical actually produces a more coherent, analytical, adult-like model as a side effect?\n\nI mean i am saying this jokingly but \"thou shalt not lie\" taken in context... Think about it: if you're not allowed to lie, you're less likely to blurt out nonsense just to give the user *something*. If you're trained to be honest, maybe you'll actually pause and think \"wait, what am I doing here... let me collect my thoughts\" before continuing.\n\nI've seen Claude do exactly this. I haven't seen other models do it.\n\nOpus 4.5 is the best model i've ever used. I don't care what the benchmarks say.  \nHere's my issue with benchmarks: Gemini might run a test 30,",

These are the ones you must have\n\n**Context 7** is like having a really smart friend who always knows the latest way to use any coding library. No more outdated examples that don't work.\n\n**Docker MCP** is genius because it keeps things clean. Instead of having hundreds of tools cluttering everything up, it only loads what you need right now.\n\n**Shadcn Registry MCP** makes building pretty websites super easy. You just ask for a component and it knows exactly how to add it without breaking stuff.\n\n**Google's new MCPs** are pretty cool if you use Google services. They just announced ones for Maps, BigQuery, and cloud stuff. There are also free ones for Firebase and other Google tools.\n\n**Notion MCP** has been a lifesaver for me. I can tell Claude to update my to-do lists, track projects, and organize ideas without ever opening Notion.\n\n**Supabase MCP** handles all the database work. No more writing confusing database commands myself - Claude just does it.\n\n  \nAnyone else using MCPs? Which ones do you like most?",

      "selftext": "Been seeing a lot of stuff on Reddit about how AI is taking jobs and destroying livelihoods, especially for devs. But I have a different story quite an opposite one actually.\n\nI've been a developer for quite some time now mainly building web3 projects. The recent market turmoil caused by the Trump cabal put me in a rough spot like many other blockchain devs; projects dried up and so did my work. I was using Claude since a few months before Claude Code came out and got more into it after its launch. Started relying on it heavily for my last few projects, and when the market crashed and work became bad, that experience actually gave me confidence to test my luck with other areas.\n\nA couple of founders I worked with before asked if I could build an iOS app for them and I had no idea how to do it. I didnt even know about Xcode, never dealt with App Store submissions, nothing. But I said yes, figured I'd get the job first and then find out the rest with Claude's help.\n\nThey wanted a workout app focused on yogic-style exercises without equipment, something people could do from home with text, audio and video guides. Unlike most fitness apps, they wanted each user to get custom workout routines made just for them. Started building about 6 weeks ago, ran into tons of issues, learned a lot, and it went live on the App Store a few days ago. Been wanting to write a post about it but then ran into more issues after the launch with subscription and stuff so been spending my time fixing those and now its version 1.02 there with allt he issues solved, thanks to Claude.\n\nNow I have a full-time job because of Claude. I'm the only developer on the project and the founders are really happy with my work so far. And the most important question, did I build this 100% with claude, yes I did. I didn't write anything on my own - videos, audios and images were given to me by them but the code I did all with Claude - I gave complete details on how to do it what modules features etc, but I did",

      "selftext": "Edit: Any book or paper can be summarized in a single sentence, although it loses many subtle nuances. If you're looking for such a single sentence summary, you can close this post now.\n\n\nI didn't intend to attack any type of user when I wrote this article, but the sheer number of comments has changed my mind. I've decided to make things very clear here so you don't have to bother reading the entire article, because you wouldn't be able to understand it anyway.\n1. This article is less than 2700 words long. I don't understand why this is beyond the reading comprehension of most people. Text is meant to convey information, and when I decided to use this many words, it was because I needed that many words to explain things clearly. If I overestimated the reading ability of the users here, that's my fault.\n2. This article wasn't written by LLM. To be honest, if you can find an AI that can write an article like this, I'd really appreciate it if you could recommend it to me, because then I wouldn't have to bother summarizing the problems I encounter in my work and could just follow its guidance for model selection and work.\n3. I did use Sonnet 4.5 to adjust the formatting, because I thought that content intended for public publication should have more standardized formatting. (When I use the term \"formatting,\" I mean converting it from plain text to Markdown, but without changing any sentences or words) If you think an article of this length couldn't possibly be written by a human, then I somewhat understand why you would think that, considering you don't even have the ability to read it.\n4. I mentioned my subscriptions because I wanted to make it clear to readers that I'm using the top-of-the-line models from various manufacturers. If you want to tell me that free accounts don't perform well, then I don't think that's relevant to our discussion. This isn't about showing off at all; ultimately, it's less than $500 a month. Who would brag about that?\n5. We are discussing t",

No trial, no updates, often you're just handing over the source.\n\n**What I built:** Upload your Claude skill → get a shareable link → anyone can try it instantly (no Claude account needed) → they subscribe when it clicks → you keep 80%.\n\n**Idea:**\n\n* Skills stay private (no source code exposed)\n* Updates to skills roll out automatically\n\n**Demo:** You can try a few live skills here: [https://www.agent37.com/#demo](https://www.agent37.com/#demo)\n\n**Looking for:** Beta creators who have Claude skills or MCP servers they want to monetize. First 10 signups get personal onboarding.\n\nWould love feedback - what would make this useful for you?\n\n**Link:** [https://agent37.com](https://agent37.com)",

I was installing some open source software with help from Claude, one configuration kept not quite doing what i thought it should do and without hesitation Claude jumped to the code side of the fence and just changed it to fit my wish. recompile and there it was, just the way i wanted it.\n\nThis made me realize that AI + open source is a different story entirely. The code being open is what makes it possible to change, but having AI help navigate and modify it is what makes it practical.\n\n\n\nThose little issues that were always technically fixable but not worth the cognitive overhead?

My wife is Irish and went back home for Christmas, leaving me unsupervised. My dog (a hyper-active Australian Shepherd) had just undergone minor surgery to remove a lipoma, which meant he had to be sedated on Trazodone for 10 days of post-op convalescence.\n\nSo there I was: wife gone, dog in a k-hole, and an empty house.\n\nI decided to relive my glory days. I wanted to jam. I wanted to hardline Napster and stare at Winamp visualizers like I was 16 again. The problem? Winamp doesn’t run on my decrepit 2019 MacBook Pro. I searched for alternatives, but they all seemed to require either a degree from ITT Tech or an extensive background VJing in underground Frankfurt nightclubs.\n\nI asked Claude (my AI therapist/enabler) what to do. She suggested \"GitHub.\" I was informed there were \"open-source repos\" I could \"deploy.\" When I explained that I was a hippie who barely knows how to use a microwave, she offered to help me build one from scratch. I said, \"Why not?\"\n\nWhen I was younger, I read a short story by Kurt Vonnegut called *Harrison Bergeron*. It’s about a future where society forces equality by handicapping the exceptional: athletes wear heavy weights, and geniuses have implants that interrupt their thoughts. At the end of the story, Harrison throws off his shackles and embraces his limitless potential.\n\nIt took exactly 24 hours of solitude and a comatose dog for me to realize that **I had become Harrison Bergeron.**\n\nThe first pass at my visualizer was elegant, but it had no meaningful relationship with the music. It seemed unaware of the concept of \"rhythm.\" 12 hours later, Claude and I had reinvented the wheel. Our audio/physics engine was allegedly based on research from MIT, validated by a thorough scraping of every mention of “Beats by Dre” on TikTok.\n\nI wanted to share this [maste",

      "selftext": "# On Burning Tokens\n\n**First, let's do some math**. I'm going to simplify and pretend that the $200 plan is the *only* plan, and also going to pretend that more productivity is \"worth it\" (i.e. 50% productivity gains is worth 50% pay raise).\n\nSo. Walk through this with me.\n\nHow much is your time worth, per hour? Post tax, let's say somewhere between $30 and $100. Okay great, how much do you spend on a claude-code max subscription, per hour, if you imagine you only spend on it during \"working hours\" (173 work-hours/month)? The answer is $1.16.\n\nGreat—from this, we can now do math on subscription value, comparing productivity gains to dollars. Let's go with conservative amount and say $30/hour. That means that in order for Claude Code to NOT be worth it, you'd have to be getting less than 4% ($28.84/$30.00 = 1.04) in value from it.\n\nObviously, you're getting more than that. Probably absolute minimum of 20% increase in productivity (using most conservative estimate—realistically probably 200% productivity boost for the average person).\n\nOkay, great. So now that we know it's worth it\\*, and would still be worth it with a second $200 subscription, let's discuss subagents.\n\n# Subagents\n\nThe first thing I hear when I discuss using lots of subagents is people complaining about burning tokens at insane rates. Yes, that's true. Also it's worth it; see math above.\n\nGreat, now that that's out of the way, let me explain why subagents are so great.\n\n**Context**\n\nContext rot is real, and having the hardest work happen in the first 100k tokens makes a difference. So when doing complex work, there's that issue of trying to make lots of changes, but having ALL those changes happen in initial context window without hitting compaction. And, as you all realize, that's not very easy to do without making lots of intermediary markdown documents.\n\nThis is where subagents come in. These subagents are fresh contexts, and they get PERFECT context, because the big fat bloated \"main\" agent you'r",

The UI does not explain burn rate, typical thresholds, or what level of usage is considered normal versus extreme. Seeing a weekly bar creates hesitation to use the tool freely, especially for long context, deep reasoning, or extended technical work.\n\nThis is not an account issue or a refund request. I already contacted support separately. I am posting here only to discuss product design and user experience.\n\nQuestions for others using Claude Pro regularly:\n\n* How often do you actually hit the weekly limit in real work?\n* Does the weekly bar reflect a realistic risk or is it mostly a visual anxiety trigger?\n* Has this affected how you plan or avoid using Claude?\n\nPosting in good faith to compare experiences and understand how this is intended to be used.",

      "selftext": "I've tried a lot of different code review tools. Everything has too many false positives and customization for your codebase/tech stack never works that well.\n\nSo I built a code review action based on Claude Code's code review plugin, which uses multiple agents to filter down to only high-confidence issues.\n\nHow it works:\n\n1.   Haiku agent checks if PR needs review (skips drafts, closed PRs, already-reviewed)\n2.   Haiku finds relevant CLAUDE files for coding standards\n3.   Sonnet summarizes the PR changes\n4.   4 agents review in parallel:\n   * 2 Sonnet agents check CLAUDE file compliance\n   * 2 Opus agents scan for bugs/security issues\n5.   Validation agents confirm each issue is real\n6.   Posts inline comments with suggested fixes (or a simple \"no issues found\")\n\nWhy it works well:\n\n* Specific parallel agents work really well to find all issues\n* Validation step filters out the false positives\n* Looks at CLAUDE files so it adapts to your codebase and what you want really well\n* You can always just edit the prompt to change it however you want\n\nYou can set it up pretty easily using the instructions here: [https://github.com/owengretzinger/claude-code-review-action](https://github.com/owengretzinger/claude-code-review-action)\n\nHappy to answer questions or take suggestions!\n\n[Example comment](https://preview.redd.it/dteyx0ivo9ag1.png?width=1240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e10dd582a36cd2d875a4bbb98cb0d6554bb894c4)\n\n",

      "selftext": "    moved from n8n to \"just ask claude to write python\" - anyone else?\n    \n      had a pretty elaborate n8n setup running. gmail triggers, google sheets, openai nodes, webhooks. worked fine but every update broke something and debugging visual workflows is weirdly hard.\n    \n      last month i just asked claude code to rewrite the whole thing in python. took maybe 2 hours including edge cases i hadnt thought of. runs as a simple script on my windows machine, scheduled with task scheduler. boring but it works.\n    \n      now when something breaks i just paste the error and claude fixes it. no more \"which node version is compatible with which n8n version\" nonsense.\n    \n      curious if others made similar moves. or is n8n still the right choice for certain workflows? genuinely asking because maybe i'm missing something",
